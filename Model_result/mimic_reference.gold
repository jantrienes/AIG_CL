No confluent consolidation or pulmonary edema . Dr . ___ communicated the above results to Dr . ___ at 6 :03 pm ___ ___ by telephone .
1 . Diffuse interstitial opacities in the right lung and very mild in left lung base , in view of history most likely reflect lung infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
