Grossly similar appearance of left perihilar opacity corresponding to known mass and adjacent opacity . Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may relate to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis , although
1 . Interval drainage of large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis . New small left pleural effusion . 2 . Increased central venous engorgement , suggestive of hypervolemia .
1 . No pneumothorax . 2 . Mild interstitial edema , improved compared to _ _ _ .
1 . No radiopaque foreign body identified . 2 . Chronic opacification in the right upper lobe and perihilar region compatible with radiation fibrosis . 3 . Small bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left
1 . No evidence of pneumonia . 2 . Possible new left upper lobe nodule ; CT of the chest is recommended for further evaluation .
Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema . Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis , however , underlying consolidation is not excluded .
1 . Findings suggesting pulmonary fibrosis at the lung bases . 2 . Air - fluid level in the mediastinum , not specific but which could be seen with esophageal dysmotility .
Bibasilar opacities , in the appropriate clinical setting , may be due to atelectasis ; however , consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded .
A left - sided pacer remains in place with the leads intact and terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle , respectively . Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable . Lungs appear well in
1 . Increased small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature , consistent with mild congestive failure . 2 . More focal appearing consolidations in the right middle lobe and a
1 . Standard positioning of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes . 2 . Small bilateral pneumothoraces . 3 . More focal opacity in the left mid lung field is nonspecific , and could reflect
1 . Increased lucency at the right lung base suggests a residual component of pneumothorax . 2 . Retrocardiac opacity , likely atelectasis . 3 . Bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion / interstitial edema and small left pleural effusion .
1 . Interval placement of right transjugular central venous catheter , distal tip not well evaluated , but likely terminates in the expected location of the mid SVC . 2 . Diffuse opacification of the right
1 . Endotracheal tube ends just above the carina . Recommend retracting at least 3 cm for optimal positioning . 2 . Nasogastric tube in the proximal stomach with sidehole at the level of the
1 . Progression of the bilateral parenchymal opacities , right greater than left , concerning for multifocal infection and / or metastatic disease . 2 . Possible trace right pleural effusion , which may have
1 . Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema with small bilateral pleural effusions . 2 . ET tube terminating 1 cm above the carina and the ET tube cuff is hyperinflated .
1 . Repositioning of the left PICC with the tip now terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein . 2 . Increased small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening bibasilar atelectasis
1 . Right IJ central line terminates in the right atrium . 2 . No acute cardiopulmonary process .
Increased opacity throughout the left upper lobe and lingula is concerning for pneumonia . Short term followup radiographs are recommended within _ _ _ weeks after treatment to document resolution .
1 . Right lower lobe consolidation worrisome for pneumonia . 2 . 1 . 9 - cm nodular opacity projecting between the posterior right sixth and seventh ribs , new since _ _ _ , could relate to consolidation or pulmonary nodule . Re
1 . Slight interval increase in moderate loculated right pleural effusion compared to the most recent radiograph from _ _ _ . 2 . Right mid to lower lung opacities could be partially due to overlying pleural
New right mid / lower lung opacity , given the rapid development of this finding , is worrisome for aspiration _ _ _ atelectasis . Infection or aspiration pneumonitis could also be considered in the appropriate
1 . Increased retrocardiac density , consistent with left lower lobe collapse and / or consolidation . 2 . Lines and tubes as described . 3 . Suspect old granulomatous disease , not significantly changed . 4 . Two cal
